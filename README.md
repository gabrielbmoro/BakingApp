# Baking App - Udacity Course

### Implementation

- Instructions to the User

I created three screens:

    * Main Screen: List all recipes;
    * Recipe Detail Screen: Show the recipe details (ingredients, and steps);
    * Step Detail Screen: Show some description about the step, and video teaching how to do the step.

- About the project

The project was created using three layers: 

    * model - Store the value objects;
    * ui - Define the user interface behavior, screens, view models, and others visual things;
    * api - Provide the request service.
